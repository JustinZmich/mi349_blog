                <p>My Great Grandma Laura is turning 100 this year. I am going to her birthday party on November 15th and 
                I’m excited because I’ve never been to someone’s 100th birthday before. She was born in 1920 in the suburbs of Detroit. 
                Her parents immigrated here from Lithuania and they ended up becoming bootleggers during the Great Depression. 
                I like to think that’s where I get my entrepreneurial attitude, but who’s to say for sure?</p>
                <p>Great Grandma Laura worked as a secretary for fifty years. Everyone in her office loved her because she was so nice 
                and would bring people lunch every day. My dad would always tell me that my Grandma Laura was the nicest person ever, 
                and that she would chase away bullies who were sometimes picking on my dad. She is always so generous and has always 
                given money to friends and family in need.</p>
                <p>Now that Grandma Laura is so elderly, she lives with my grandparents in their house. 
                She sadly does not remember much nowadays because she has Alzheimer’s. 
                But seeing her still makes me remember going to her house as a kid and playing hopscotch or playing cards when my parents came too.</p>

                    <p>As a Shipt Shopper, I deal with seniors as customers on a pretty regular basis. 
                        Since the beginning of the pandemic a growing number of seniors are taking shelter in their homes 
                        and these people are increasingly relying on food and grocery delivery services, such as Shipt, 
                        to maintain their standard of living during their quarantine. This service is even more vital for seniors with 
                        diabetes or other underlying conditions who need to restock on toilet paper, hand sanitizer, or other essential goods. 
                        The issue for many seniors is their reliance on fixed income, either through pensions or the government, makes it hard 
                        to pay even the $10 monthly subscription fee Shipt charges for its customers. But, according to a recent news story, 
                        many more seniors in the Detroit area will gain access to Shipt for free.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to officials in Macomb county, the senior residence of this county will receive free grocery delivery 
                        through Shipt for a one-year period. There are some stipulations, the order must be called in on a toll-free number 
                        and the order must be over $35 in value or the customer will receive an additional $7 charge. 
                        You can read more about the story on the <a href="https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/macomb-county-partners-with-shipt-to-help-seniors-get-food-delivered-for-free" target="_blank">Fox 2 Detroit website article here.</a></p>
